## Recommendation System
Build a movie recommendation system by conducting matrix factorization with bias and collborative filtering with gradient descent.

## Spam Detection

Implementing ada boost from the scratch to classify spam and perform comparisons between ada boost and gradient boosting tree.

## MNIST_Neural_Net

Pytorch Vanilla version of neural network using MNIST dataset

## IMDB Sentiment Analysis

Implement word embedding to classify sentiments of movie reviews into positive and negative. The large [movie view dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) contains a collection of 50,000 reviews from IMDB. The dataset contains an even number of positive and negative reviews.<br/>
The pre-trained Glove embedding can be downloaded [here](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).
